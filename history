## History Configuration

## Options relating to saving history
export HISTSIZE=10000
export SAVEHIST=6000
export HISTFILE=$XDG_STATE_HOME/zsh/history

set hist_ignore_dups		## Don't log the same thing twice
set hist_ignore_space		## Don't log things that start with space
set hist_reduce_blanks		## Compact unnecessary white-space
set hist_expire_dups_first	## Remove duplicates first (if any exist) when compacting history
set hist_save_no_dups		## Remove duplicates from history when writing

## Options relating to history use
set hist_find_no_dups		## Don't show duplicates when searching history
set hist_verify				## Dont' immediately execute expanded history `eg: sudo !!`

## This stops certain commands saving into the history file
export HISTORY_IGNORE='(cd(| *)|ls(| *)|pushd(| *)|popd(| *))'

## This hook goes even further and stops anything in the $HISTORY_IGNORE list from being
## added to the session local history (it still stays around in the up buffer until you run a new command afterwards)
zshaddhistory() {
	emulate -L zsh
	[[ ${1%%$'\n'} != ${~HISTORY_IGNORE} ]]
}
